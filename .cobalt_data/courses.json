South Asia is a place where many external cultural traditions mixed with indigenous traditions to create new socioeconomic and sociopolitical entities and sequences. While we will examine classic examples of hunter-gatherer groups, early villages, urban settlements, regional polities, and large empires through time, we will also stress the contemporaneity of groups of people with very different lifestyles -- hunter-gatherers participated in trading networks with town and city dwellers, pastoral nomads moved through settled village regions during their annual migrations. The impact of archaeological research on the region today is seen through the politicization of South Asian prehistory and history that has strongly affected both interpretations of the past and modern political events. Cases such as the debate over the identity of the Harappans and the existence of the Aryans will be evaluated from both an archaeological and a political perspective.

This relationship refers to an understanding of the microstructure of a solid, that is, the nature of the bonds between atoms and the spatial arrangement of atoms, which permits the explanation of observed behaviour. Observed materials behaviour includes mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical, and corrosive behaviour. Topics covered in this course include: structure of the atom, models of the atom, electronic configuration, the electromagnetic spectrum, band theory, atomic bonding, optical transparency of solids, magnetic properties, molecular bonding, hybridized orbitals, crystal systems, lattices and structures, crystallographic notation, imperfections in solids, reaction rates, activation energy, solid-state diffusion, materials thermodynamics, free energy, and phase equilibrium.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Engineering First Year

Strategic use of technology in all sorts of businesses makes the difference between success and failure for these firms. Wealth creation is a real option for many and the business atmosphere is ready for you! Increasingly, people are seeing the advantages of doing their own thing, in their own way, in their own time. Entrepreneurs can control their own lives, structure their own progress and be accountable for their own success - they can fail, but they can not be fired! After all, engineers are the most capable people to be in the forefront of this drive to the business life of the next century. This course is the first of a series of two dealing with entrepreneurship and management of a small company. It is intended that the student would continue to take the follow up course APS432 as s/he progresses toward the engineering degree. Therefore, it is advisable that the descriptions of both courses be studied prior to deciding to take this one. This is a limited enrolment course. If the number of students electing to take the course exceeds the class size limit, selection of the final group will be made on the basis of the “Entrepreneur’s Test”. There will be a certificate awarded upon the successful completion of both courses attesting to the fact that the student has passed this Entrepreneurial Course Series at the University of Toronto. The course is based on real life issues, not theoretical developments or untried options. Topics covered include: Who is an entrepreneur; Canadian business environment; Acquisitions; Different business types (retail, wholesale, manufacturing, and services); Franchising; Human resources, Leadership, Business law; and many others. Several visitors are invited to provide the student with the opportunity to meet real entrepreneurs. There will be several assignments and a session project. It should be noted that the 5 hours per week would all be used for whatever is needed at the time, so tutorials will not normally happen as the calendar indicates them.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Cross Disciplinary Programs Office","prerequisites":"","exclusions":"CHE488H1/CIV488H1/ECE488H1/MIE488H1/MSE488H1","level":200,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2016 Fall","breadths":[],"meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","instructors":["J Paradi"],"times":[{"day":"THURSDAY","start":64800,"end":72000,"duration":7200,"location":"GB 248"},{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":64800,"end":72000,"duration":7200,"location":"GB 248"}],"size":200,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0101","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":72000,"end":75600,"duration":3600,"location":"GB 248"}],"size":100,"enrolment":0}]}

The student considering taking this course would typically plan to pursue a career in small business started by him/herself, or in a family enterprise. The skills acquired, however, are very useful in any business where a graduate might end up in his/her career, without the need for actually being an entrepreneur. Our approach to teaching is based on real-life business experiences and many years of successful practice of “what we preach”. The course contains very little theoretical work or academic approaches. It is designed to familiarise you with the kinds of opportunities (problems) likely to be encountered in an entrepreneurial career. If you really want this lifestyle and are prepared to work hard, we will provide you with the practical knowledge and technical skills required to pursue this kind of career. Topics covered in this course include: Marketing and Sales; Legal issues; Financing the business; Human Resources challenges, the Business Plan and many other issues. Note that the course material may be adjusted between the two courses as required. We recognize the value of communication skills in both the classroom and in project reports. In fact, we require that you learn how to present yourself in a business-like manner. As and when appropriate, outside visitors from the business community will join in and contribute to the class discussions. The course deals with practical concepts, actual past and current events and is presented from the point of view of someone who has “done it all”. This means that what you hear is the real stuff. There will be several assignments and the preparation of a full Business Plan as the session project. It should be noted that the 5 hours per week would all be used for whatever is needed at the time, so tutorials will not normally happen as the calendar indicates them.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Cross Disciplinary Programs Office","prerequisites":"APS234 - Entrepreneurship and Small Business","exclusions":"CHE488H1/CIV488H1/ECE488H1/MIE488H1/MSE488H1","level":400,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2017 Winter","breadths":[],"meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":64800,"end":75600,"duration":10800,"location":"GB 248"},{"day":"THURSDAY","start":64800,"end":72000,"duration":7200,"location":"GB 248"}],"size":95,"enrolment":0}]}

By the end of the course, students should be able to write simple sentences to express basic information, and they should be able to conduct basic conversations in formal Arabic. Everyday language in the Egyptian and Levantine accents will be provided occasionally as supplementary materials for students' information only. However, students' skills will be assessed using formal Arabic only, which is the focus of this course.[72L, 24P] NOTE: All students who are enrolling in an ARA language course for the first time (do not have the prerequisite) are required to complete a language assessment questionnaire.
